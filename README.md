# StuDIO
My WebApp project: Student x Portfolio, StuDIO, for Mirosoft Student Accelerator Phase 2, 2025

# Description 
StuDIO is a blend of the words "Student" and "Portfolio". It emphasises the webapp's purpose in being a convenient and explicit way for students to showcase their skills and capabilities to other people, especially in settings such as class group projects, hackathons, and networking events. 

It highlights their skills and allows for a display that acts as their portfolio. Essentially it's a more casual way to bring up conversation, show credibility, and help students who especially feel daunted to take that first step in making conversation for such events - an experience many know too well.

# Theme Relevance 
StuDIO relates to the theme of "Networking" because it's designed to be a tool that students can use to showcase their skills and make the most out of opportunities surrounding networking events and teams. It helps relieve the pressure of memorising the (various) projects a student may have done/participated in and helps follow up when asked: "So what are you good at?" or "How's your level in *this* particular skill?". What better way to show and remember when StuDIO has it recorded by you?
